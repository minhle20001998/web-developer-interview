# Approach

In this project, since the API endpoints return static responses, all filtering and search functionalities are handled entirely on the frontend. When users search or apply filters, the client processes the static data fetched from the server by matching it against the search keyword or filter criteria.

- Filter the search results to include only items with titles containing the search term, ignoring case sensitivity.
- Provide search suggestions that contain the search term within the suggestion content, maintaining case sensitivity.

# Libraries

- Typescript: TypeScript is a language for application-scale JavaScript
- React: React is the library for web and native user interfaces.
- Jest: A testing framework for javascript applications.
- Tailwindcss: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- Debounce: Delay function calls until a set time elapses after the last invocation
